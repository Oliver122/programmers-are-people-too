# Programmers Are People Too ✨

> *Celebrate your coding wins! Break the negative feedback loop with positive reinforcement in VS Code.*

## Why This Extension Exists �

Development tools are great at telling us what's wrong - red underlines for errors, yellow squiggles for warnings, angry compiler messages. But they never celebrate when we **fix** things, **improve** code, or **solve** problems.

**Success is just silence.** That's not very motivating, is it?

This extension changes that by introducing **positive reinforcement** into your coding workflow. Because programmers are people too, and people deserve to feel good about their work! 🎉

## Features ✨

### 🎊 Instant Celebrations
- **Real-time feedback** when you fix errors or warnings
- **Encouraging notifications** when diagnostics improve
- **Progress tracking** in the "ProgrammersArePeopleToo" output panel
- **Detailed logging** of all your coding improvements

### 🔍 Smart Monitoring
- Automatically detects when error/warning counts decrease
- Celebrates incremental improvements (5 errors → 3 errors = progress!)
- Special recognition when files go from problematic to completely clean
- Works with all language servers and diagnostic providers

### 🎯 Motivation Boost
- Transforms the coding experience from "avoid punishment" to "earn rewards"
- Builds positive associations with code improvement activities
- Encourages iterative refinement and quality improvements
- Makes debugging and refactoring more satisfying

## How It Works 🛠️

The extension monitors VS Code's diagnostic system (the same system that shows red/yellow underlines) and celebrates when things improve:

1. **Tracks Changes**: Monitors diagnostic events across all open files
2. **Detects Improvements**: Compares current vs. previous error/warning counts  
3. **Celebrates Progress**: Shows positive feedback when issues are resolved
4. **Logs Everything**: Detailed tracking in output panel and console

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open any project** with linting/diagnostic errors
3. **Start fixing issues** - the extension will automatically celebrate your progress!
4. **Check the output panel** ("ProgrammersArePeopleToo") to see detailed feedback

### Commands
