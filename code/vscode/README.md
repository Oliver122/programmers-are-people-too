## Why This Extension Exists 🌟

Development tools are great at telling us what's wrong - red underlines for errors, yellow squiggles for warnings, angry compiler messages. But they never celebrate when we **fix** things, **improve** code, or **solve** problems.

**Success is just silence.** That's not very motivating, is it?

This extension changes that by introducing **positive reinforcement** into your coding workflow. Because programmers are people too, and people deserve to feel good about their work! 🎉

## How It Works 🛠️

The extension monitors VS Code's diagnostic system (the same system that shows red/yellow underlines) and celebrates when things improve:

1. **Tracks Changes**: Monitors diagnostic events across all open files
2. **Detects Improvements**: Compares current vs. previous error/warning counts  
3. **Celebrates Progress**: Shows positive feedback when issues are resolved
4. **Logs Everything**: Detailed tracking in output panel and console

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open any project** with linting/diagnostic errors
3. **Start fixing issues** - the extension will automatically celebrate your progress!
4. **Check the output panel** ("ProgrammersArePeopleToo") to see detailed feedback

### Commands

- **`Programmers Are People Too: Cheer Me Up`** - Get a beautiful motivational panel showing your recent achievements
  - Displays fixed errors and warnings
  - Shows completed tasks
  - Highlights files you've created and modified
  - Personalized encouragement based on your activity level
  - Over 165 unique message variations to keep it fresh!
